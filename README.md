# Mangrove1.0: A Dynamic Data Management System for Advanced AI Applications

Unlock a new paradigm of data management with Mangroveâ€”a high-density, multi-dimensional data structure engineered to streamline variable handling across various depths and types. Mangrove simplifies data management in Robotics, NLP, computer vision and other AI applications by providing a versatile and efficient way to handle variables of varying types and depths. By using Mangrove, you can focus more on your AI model development and less on data organization.

## Description
Mangrove is a utility data structure designed to manage various types of data within multi-layered superstructures, denoted by 'depths.' It offers high-fidelity operations, including the ability to transfer values to the GPU for accelerated computing. As the program runs, Mangrove naturally organizes data in a structured manner based on its importance and requirements. It can move priority tensors to the GPU for computation and later retrieve them, adding them back as attributes within the same instance. This provides an end-to-end management utility well-suited for large-scale, episodic training processes and data acquisition systems, making it highly versatile and applicable to a range of use cases.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Use the `config()` function to easily specify data type constraints for various depths. The system prevents incompatible configurations.
- **Data Ingestion**: With `add_data()`, you can add new variables dynamically while ensuring they meet the established type and depth requirements.
- **Insightful Summaries**: The `summary()` method provides a quick, detailed overview of your data's types, depths, and more.
- **Dynamic Access**: Use Pythonic `__getattr__` and `__setattr__` methods for on-the-fly variable access, with robust error handling.
- **Result Caching**: We use caching to store local information to prevent too many Dictionary lookups.

## Special Functionalities
- **Seamless GPU Acceleration**: The `tocuda` method effortlessly transfers your data to a CUDA-enabled GPU.
- **Dynamic Depth Management**: The `push` functionality enables you to adjust variable depths on-the-fly, optimizing your data organization.
- **Depth 0**: A special layer for untyped data, providing a flexible foundation for early-stage projects.

## Methods
- `config()`: Define type constraints for variable depths.
- `add_data()`: Add variables dynamically, with automatic type and depth checks.
- `summary()`: Get an insightful snapshot of the state of your data.
- `__getattr__` and `__setattr__`: Dynamic variable access with robust error handling.
- `tocuda()`: Streamline the transfer of variables to CUDA-enabled GPUs.
- `push()`: Modify the depth of a variable dynamically.
- `shift()`: Move any variable to a destination depth.

## Requirements

- CUDA-enabled GPU
- Python 3.x
- Torch >=1.8
- Sympy

## Usage

You can now import the Mangroves library in your Python code and use them directly for instantiation. A set of use cases is provided below:

```python
import torch
from mangroves.mangrove import Mangrove, MangroveException

def main():
    try:
        print("Initializing Mangrove object...")
        mangrove = Mangrove()

        print("Configuring depth 1...")
        mangrove.config(1, [int, float, torch.Tensor])
        print("Depth 1 configured.")

        print("Adding data to depth 1...")
        mangrove.add_data(1, int, ["age"], [25])
        mangrove.add_data(1, float, ["height"], [5.9])
        print("Data added to depth 1.")

        print("Adding tensor data to depth 0 (pre-configured)...")
        mangrove.add_data(0, torch.Tensor, ["tensor_data"], [torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])])
        print("Tensor data added to depth 0.")

        print("Directly accessing variable 'age'...")
        print("Accessing directly:", mangrove.age)

        print("Updating the 'age' variable...")
        mangrove.age = 26
        print("Age updated.")

        print("Accessing summary...")
        summary = mangrove.summary()
        print("Summary:", summary)

        print("Getting variables at depth 1...")
        print("Variables at depth 1:", mangrove.var(depth=1))

        print("Getting variables of type int...")
        print("Variables of type int:", mangrove.var(data_type=int))

        print("Indexing at depth 1...")
        print("Indexing at depth 1:", mangrove.index(depth=1))

        print("Pushing 'tensor_data' to depth 1...")
        mangrove.push(1, "tensor_data")
        print("'tensor_data' pushed to depth 1.")

        print("Moving all tensor variables to CUDA...")
        mangrove.tocuda(data_type=torch.Tensor)
        print("All tensor variables moved to CUDA.")

        # Retrieving tensor_data from CUDA and adding it to depth 1
        print("Retrieving 'tensor_data' back from CUDA...")
        tensor_data_cpu = mangrove.tensor_data.cpu()
        print("Retrieved 'tensor_data' back from CUDA.")

        print("Adding retrieved 'tensor_data' to depth 1...")
        mangrove.add_data(1, torch.Tensor, ["retrieved_tensor_data"], [tensor_data_cpu])
        print("Retrieved 'tensor_data' added to depth 1.")

        print("Adding tensor data to depth 0 (pre-configured)...")
        mangrove.add_data(0, torch.Tensor, ["tensor_data"], [torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])])
        print("Tensor data added to depth 0.")
        
        # Test shift operation
        print("Shifting 'tensor_data' from depth 0 to depth 1...")
        mangrove.shift(to=1, variable_name="tensor_data")
        print("'tensor_data' shifted to depth 1.")

        print("Attempting to shift 'age' to depth that doesn't support its type...")
        try:
            mangrove.shift(to=2, variable_name="age")
        except MangroveException as e:
            print("Expected error occurred:", e)
        
        print("Shifting 'age' back to depth 0...")
        mangrove.shift(to=0, variable_name="age")
        print("'age' shifted to depth 0.")

    except MangroveException as e:
        print("An error occurred:", e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
